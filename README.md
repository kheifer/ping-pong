# Ping-Pong: A Fun game to test BDD and JavaScript

#### Week Three - JavaScript Arrays and Looping Independent Project

#### _Ping Pong, 07.10.2017_

#### By _**Kheifer Fuller**_

## Description
_The ping-pong test is designed to display a user's understanding of basic looping and arrays. To further expand upon that knowledge the JavaScript page is also divided into front-end(user interface logic) and back-end(business logic) development. Below is a list of the specs used to guide Behavior Driven Development(BDD)._

Behavior                                                          | Input  | Output
----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------
The application collects the input data | 2 |[2]
The application can count up to the number provided by the input | 2 | [1, 2]
The application can create an array of all the numbers from one to any number a user inputs | 2001 | [1,2, 3 ... 2001]
Given a number divisible by 3 the application returns with "ping" | [3] | [1, 2, "ping"]
Given a number divisible by 5 the application returns with "pong" | [5] | [1, 2, ping, 4, "pong"]
Given a number divisible by 15 the application returns with "pingpong" | [15] | [1, 2, ping, 4, pong..."pingpong"]
The application outputs both word and number strings in an array | 3 | [1, 2, ping]
The application returns new results for each number  | [4, 5] | [(1, 2, "ping", 4), (1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong")]
The application returns the results in a bulleted list  | [4, 5]] | [(1, 2, "ping", 4), (1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong")]
